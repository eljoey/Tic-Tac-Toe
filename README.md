# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe game made for The Odin Project.  Project page is here <https://eljoey.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe>

## Goal

The goal of this project was to create a Tic Tac Toe game which used as little global code as possible trying to tuck everything into modules and factories.

## Game Modes

- A.I. mode will make the computer pick a random square out of the remaining empty squares
- A.I. Impossible Mode will use the minimax theorem to pick the best possible move for the computer out of the remaining moves available.
- Two Player mode will let the user play against a friend at the same computer.

## Instructions

Choose which mode you would like to try and then click the 'Start' button.  You can at any point hit restart and the game state will clear and let you choose your mode again.  After your current game finishes you can hit the start button to play again.

## Credits

- I got the css animations from animista.net
- Help with the minimax theorem from freeCodeCamp video here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2TcQ3h0ipQ>
